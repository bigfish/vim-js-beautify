## Vim JS Beautify

Uses Node.js to run js-beautify on the current buffer.

Requires: Node.js

Usage:

    :JSBeautify

Processes whole file by default, but using a range may also work.

You could map to a key in .vimrc, eg:

    nmap <leader>b :JSBeautify<cr>

Warning: may take a while for large files
